        STUDY CONCLUSION:
        While treatment Y showed promising results in laboratory
        settings, clinical trials demonstrated that treatment Y
        is NOT recommended for general use due to significant
        side effects outweighing benefits. Further research is
        needed before treatment Y can be considered safe.
