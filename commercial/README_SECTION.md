**Forensic Audit of Intelligent Logic**

> "Because your agent is a fluent liar and it's time for an interrogation."

**What you get:**
- 50 curated test cases (organized into 3 audit levels)
- Step-by-step audit runbook
- Executive-friendly report template
- Production gate enforcement code (TypeScript + Python)
- Failure mode catalog
