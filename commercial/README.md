## Running a Test vs. Performing a Forensic Audit

**This repo (Ali's Book of Fail)** gives you the tools to run tests. It is free, open-source, and MIT-licensed. You can clone it, run the harness, and see if your agent passes.

**The F.A.I.L. Kit** gives you the process to perform a forensic audit. It is a curated, structured product for teams that need to ship now.
